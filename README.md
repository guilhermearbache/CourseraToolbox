## Some tips:

  * So far, only these headings and lists
  
  * For a quick guide on RStudio - click the MD button

  * http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/
  
##Using R:

  * a<- available.packages () CHECK AVAILABLE PACKAGES

  * Then type "a" to see all of them (TYPE ANYTHING?)

  * head(rownames(a), 3) TO CHECK ONLY SOME OF THEM, LIKE THE THREE FIRST ONES.
  
  * install.packages("slidify") 
  * install.packages(c("slidify", "ggplot2")
  * library(solidify)
  * Any package to be loaded as dependencies will be loaded first - hence the problem I have with ggplot2
  
  * search() - TO SEE ALL THE FUNCTIONS OF THE PACKAGE (AFTER LIBRARY ONLY?)
  
  Will I use bioclite? - If YES, check around 3.20 of "Installing R Packages" video
  
## RTools

* First, I'm not sure if I did everything right (like checking the box to have the installer edit my PATH or having already the cygwin installed, not sure if I have and if that will be a problem - ver 1.40 do video "Installing RTools")
